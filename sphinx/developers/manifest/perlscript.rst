Perl scripts in UBOS manifests
==============================

Most application instrumentation in UBOS can be accomplished purely with
``ubos-manifest.json`` and template files that are parameterized with variable names.

Sometimes, however, a script is necessary. For that purpose, AppConfigItems and
installers/upgraders of type ``perlscript`` are provided, which allow developers to run
arbitrary fragments of Perl code during certain management tasks.
To run code in some other language, simply invoke that code from a Perl script using Perl's
``system()`` function or the like.

The Perl fragment will be executed by UBOS through Perls' ``eval`` method. Two
variables are being provided by the run-time context:

* ``$operation``: contains a text string that indicates the operation that is being
  applied, such as ``deploy``, ``undeploy``, ``install``, ``uninstall``, and
  ``upgrade``.
* ``$config``: a ``UBOS::Configuration`` object that contains contextual variables,
  included all of those described in :doc:`variables`.

Perl fragments typically look like this:

.. code-block:: perl

   #!/usr/bin/perl

   use strict;
   use warnings;

   my $dataDir = $config->getResolve( 'appconfig.datadir' );
       # or look up whatever variables are needed

   if( 'install' eq $operation ) {
       # do something
   }
   if( 'uninstall' eq $operation ) {
       # do something else
   }
   # potentially more possible values of $operation
   1;

The meaning of the ``$operation`` is as follows:

* ``deploy``: applies to Perl scripts that are declared as an AppConfigurationItem. Invoked
  when the AppConfigurationItem is deployed as part of the deployment or redeployment
  of an app to a site.
* ``undeploy``: the reverse operation of ``deploy``. It applies to Perl scripts that are
  declared as an AppConfigurationItem. Invoked when the AppConfigurationItem is undeployed
  as part of the undeployment of an app from a site.
* ``install``: applies to Perl scripts that are declared as an ``installer`` in the manifest.
  Invoked when an app is deployed or redeployed to a site, after all the AppConfigurationItems
  have been deployed, but only if no data is to be restored (i.e. it is a virgin install).
* ``upgrade``: applies to Perl scripts that are declared as an ``updater`` in the manifest.
  Invoked when an app is deployed or redeployed to a site, after all the AppConfigurationItems
  have been deployed, but only if backup data is to be restored (i.e. it is a restore or
  upgrade, rather than a virgin install).
* ``uninstall``: applies to Perl scripts that are declared as an ``installer`` in the manifest.
  Invoked when an app is undeployed from a site, before all the AppConfigurationItems
  have been undeployed.

The same Perl script may be used to handle server of these operations.

For an example, refer to ``initialize.pl`` and ``upgrade.pl`` in the Wordpress package for UBOS.
Source code is `here <https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-wordpress/blob/master/wordpress/bin>`_.

This ``initialize.pl`` script is used to generate the Wordpress ``config.php`` file from a script, instead
of from a file template, and to initialize Wordpress. ``upgrade.pl`` invokes the Wordpress data
migration functionality after a Wordpress upgrade.
