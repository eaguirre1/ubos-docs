Developer FAQ
=============

Why is it called UBOS?
----------------------

Why not?

.. _faq_arch_ubos_rel:

Why did you derive UBOS from Arch Linux?
----------------------------------------

The first version of what became UBOS was actually based on debian. There are many
great things about debian, and things were going great, until early users complained that the
versions of the available web apps were "old"; they wanted the latest and greatest.
So we tried upgrading various web apps to current versions, and failed: current web apps
would require current language runtimes and libraries, and debian stable does not generally
provide them.

In the second attempt, we worked from Ubuntu. That was better in terms of being current
with web apps. But when we discovered rolling updates as provided by Arch Linux, there
was no going back: rolling upgrades are excellent for the types of systems we are
building UBOS for.


What is the relationship between UBOS and Arch Linux?
-----------------------------------------------------

UBOS is both a subset and a superset of Arch Linux:

* UBOS only includes a subset of the Arch Linux packages. For example, UBOS has picked
  Apache2 as its (current) web server and thus does not provide any other web servers.

* UBOS provides packages such as ``ubos-admin`` for one-command device
  administration, which are not available on Arch Linux; given that Arch Linux is
  intended as a broadly configurable system for the power user, philosophically they
  are not very compatible.

* UBOS provides several :term:`release channels <Release channel>`.

* UBOS releases are "full-stack" tested before they are made available. Arch Linux
  only performs unit testing, and generally requires a system administrator to
  manually review and resolve possible issues. See also :doc:`buildrelease`.

Doesn’t apt / dpkg / yum / pacman etc. do this already?
-------------------------------------------------------

No. They all manage software packages, they do not manage full configurations of those
packages.

Take WordPress as an example. If you install a WordPress package, a package manager will
dump all the WordPress code on your drive, but it is left to you to create a database and
edit the Apache virtual host configuration. That is in spite of the fact that installing
WordPress is much simpler than installing most web applications where you often also
need to install (or even compile) additional dependencies, and sometimes even get additional
services to run.

If you want to run the same application more than once on the same machine (for example,
at different virtual hosts), package managers are not able to help at all. Certainly they
also don't help with backups, restores, SSL configuration and many other administration
tasks that UBOS helps automate.

P.S. We build on ``pacman`` and each UBOS package is a valid pacman package.

Doesn’t puppet / chef / ansible etc. do this already?
-----------------------------------------------------

These are large-scale datacenter / IT automation tools, and not written for you and me
putting code on our Raspberry Pi. Conceivably we could build on one of them, but the
upside seemed small compared to the downside.

One key difference is that you and I, and everybody, will put different combinations of
applications on our devices, instead of a devops engineer putting the same combination
of code on many servers. This difference has ramifications on the tools.

What about docker?
------------------

Docker is great to isolate independent apps from each other; it isn't so great for
running, say, 5 instances of Wordpress and 3 of ownCloud on several different virtual
hosts on the same port 80.
