Glad-I-Was-Here (Java)
======================

The Java version of Glad-I-Was-Here is functionally equivalent to the
:doc:`PHP version <gladiwashere>`. However, it is implemented as Java servlets and
runs under Tomcat. If you have not already read through the :doc:`PHP version <gladiwashere>`
of Glad-I-Was-Here, we recommend you do so first.

From a user perspective, the technology used to implement a particular application that runs
on UBOS is totally irrelevant. We cannot require the user to access, say, Java apps at
a different port number than other apps installed on the same device. Because of that,
Java apps on UBOS are usually configured with Apache as a reverse proxy in front of
the Tomcat application server. Apache takes incoming requests at port 80 or 443, and
forwards them to Tomcat.

To obtain the source code:

.. code-block:: none

   > git clone https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-toyapps

Go to subdirectory ``gladiwashere-java``.

Package lifecycle and app deployment
------------------------------------

This app can, obviously, be built and deployed with a similar set of commands as
:doc:`helloworld` above:

.. code-block:: none

   > makepkg -f
   > sudo pacman -U gladiwashere-java-*-any.pkg.tar.xz
   > sudo ubos-admin createsite

Specify ``gladiwashere-java`` as the name of the app.

Manifest JSON
-------------

Let's examine this app's :term:`UBOS Manifest JSON` file. It is very similar to
``gladiwashere``'s, but has an additional entry for Tomcat:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "type" : "app",

       "roles" : {
           "apache2" : {
               "defaultcontext" : "/guestbook",
               "apache2modules" : [
                   "proxy",
                   "proxy_ajp"
               ],
               "appconfigitems" : [
                   {
                       "type" : "file",
                       "name" : "${appconfig.apache2.appconfigfragmentfile}",
                       "template"     : "tmpl/htaccess.tmpl",
                       "templatelang" : "varsubst"
                   }
               ]
           },
           "tomcat7" : {
               "defaultcontext" : "/guestbook",
               "appconfigitems" : [
                   {
                       "type"         : "file",
                       "name"         : "${appconfig.tomcat7.contextfile}",
                       "template"     : "tmpl/context.xml.tmpl",
                       "templatelang" : "varsubst"
                   }
               ]
           },
        "mysql" : {
               "appconfigitems" : [
                   {
                       "type"             : "database",
                       "name"             : "maindb",
                       "retentionpolicy"  : "keep",
                       "retentionbucket"  : "maindb",
                       "privileges"       : "select, insert"
                   }
               ],
               "installers" : [
                   {
                       "name"   : "maindb",
                       "type"   : "sqlscript",
                       "source" : "sql/create.sql"
                   }
               ]
           }
       }
   }

Let's first note what is the same as in the PHP version:

* The ``type`` is ``app`` for both, of course.

* The ``defaultcontext`` is the same.

* The entire ``mysql`` section is the same, including database permissions and
  database initialization.

Here are the differences:

* Apache now needs to use modules ``proxy`` and ``proxy_ajp``, which allow Apache to
  talk to Tomcat using the `AJP protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_JServ_Protocol>`_.
  Because there is no more PHP involved, the Apache PHP modules are not needed any more.

* Instead of having the PHP files as ``appconfigitems``, there is only one Apache
  configuration fragment file that configures Apache as a reverse proxy. This file is
  in the package as a template, so UBOS can correctly parameterize it for the particular
  AppConfiguration (see below).

* There's a new ``tomcat7`` section which configures Tomcat. All that's needed here is
  a Tomcat "context file", which again is parameterized (see below).

Note that there are no commands required to install or start Tomcat; UBOS does this
automatically when it notices that a Java app is about to be deployed.

Apache reverse proxy configuration
----------------------------------

The Apache reverse proxy configuration is quite straightforward:

.. code-block:: none

   ProxyPass ${appconfig.contextorslash} ajp://127.0.0.1:8009${appconfig.contextorslash}
   ProxyPassReverse ${appconfig.contextorslash} ajp://127.0.0.1:8009${appconfig.contextorslash}

At deployment time, UBOS will replace the variables in this template and save the
resulting file as ``.htaccess`` in the web server directory, such as:

.. code-block:: none

   ProxyPass /guestbook ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/guestbook
   ProxyPassReverse /guestbook ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/guestbook

Apache requires both of those statements, see the
`Apache documentation <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html>`_.

Tomcat context file
-------------------

Tomcat also needs to be told which app to run, and which parameters to pass ot it.
This is accomplished with the following template:

.. code-block:: none

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <Context path="${appconfig.context}"
            antiJARLocking="true"
            cookies="false"
            docBase="${package.codedir}/lib/gladiwashere-java.war">
     <Resource auth="Container"
               type="javax.sql.DataSource"
               driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
               name="jdbc/maindb"
               url="jdbc:mysql://${appconfig.mysql.dbhost.maindb}/${appconfig.mysql.dbname.maindb}"
               username="${appconfig.mysql.dbuser.maindb}"
               password="${escapeDquote( appconfig.mysql.dbusercredential.maindb )}"
               maxActive="20"
               maxIdle="10"
               maxWait="-1"/>
   </Context>

Upon deployment, UBOS will have replaced the variables, and provided it to Tomcat, for
example:

.. code-block:: none

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <Context path="/guestbook"
            antiJARLocking="true"
            cookies="false"
            docBase="/usr/share/gladiwashere-java/lib/gladiwashere-java.war">
     <Resource auth="Container"
               type="javax.sql.DataSource"
               driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
               name="jdbc/maindb"
               url="jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1/somedb"
               username="someuser"
               password="somepass"
               maxActive="20"
               maxIdle="10"
               maxWait="-1"/>
   </Context>
