Learning from the toy apps
==========================

UBOS provides two "toy" apps that help explain how to package and distribute
real web apps on UBOS:

* Hello World is an extremely simple Web applications that just displays Hello World
  when accessed over the web. We use it to give you a taste for what is involved to
  package a real web application for UBOS.
* Glad-I-Was-Here is a slightly more complex "guestbook" web application that uses a
  MySQL database to store the guestbook entries. We use it to illustrate how to package
  web apps that use a database.
