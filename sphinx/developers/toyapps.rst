Learning from the toy apps
==========================

UBOS provides two "toy" apps that help explain how to package and distribute
real web apps on UBOS:

* "Hello World" is an extremely simple Web applications that just displays Hello World
  when accessed over the web. We use it to give you a taste for what is involved to
  package a real web application for UBOS.
* "Glad-I-Was-Here" is a slightly more complex "guestbook" web application that uses a
  relational database to store the guestbook entries. We use it to illustrate how to package
  web apps that use a database. It comes in three versions:

  * one implemented in PHP with a MySQL backend, called ``gladiwashere``;
  * one implemented in PHP with a Postgresql backend, called ``gladiwashere-postgresql``; and
  * one in Java with a MySQL backend, called ``gladiwashere-java``.

You may want to read through the documentation for these apps in this sequence:
