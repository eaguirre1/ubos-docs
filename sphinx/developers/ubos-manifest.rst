UBOS Manifest
=============

Each app or accessory on UBOS has a ``ubos-manifest.json`` file, which contains
the meta-data that allows UBOS to correctly install, uninstall, backup, upgrade
etc. the app or accessory. It optionally also contains human-readable information
about the package.

This section describes the UBOS manifest and how to use it.
