UBOS Manifest
=============

Each app or accessory on UBOS has a ``ubos-manifest.json`` file, which declares how
the app or accessory would like to be installed, uninstalled, backed-up, upgraded etc.
While UBOS package management upgrades the code of the app or accessory, the UBOS manifest
describes how each installation of the app or accessory (e.g. at different virtual hosts
on the same device) needs to be configured.

This section describes the UBOS manifest and how to use it.
