``ubos-admin listnics``
=======================

See also :doc:`../../users/ubos-admin`.

This command is wrapper around ``ip link``, and parses its output in a manner that is
more suitable to UBOS. This command only exists as a debugging tool, and users or
developers do not usually need to invoke this.
