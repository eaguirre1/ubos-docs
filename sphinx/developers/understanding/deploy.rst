``ubos-admin deploy``
=====================

See also :doc:`../../users/ubos-admin`.

If the Site JSON file provided to this command is valid, UBOS will perform the following steps:

#. Install required packages that haven't been installed yet. This includes:

   * the packages of apps to be deployed per the the Site JSON, but not yet
     installed on the device;
   * the packages of accessories to be deployed per the Site JSON, but not yet
     installed on the device;
   * dependencies of those packages as listed in the respective ``PKGBUILD``
     files;
   * packages listed in the ``depends`` section of the
     :doc:`manifest JSONs <../ubos-manifest>` of the
     apps and accessories, for those roles that are being used on the device.
   * the database engine(s) required for the app, if not already installed.

#. If the site has previously been deployed, the existing site will first be suspended, and
   the data of all the apps and accessories at the site will temporarily be backed up.

#. The site's frontpage will be replaced with a placeholder saying "upgrade in progress".

#. If the site has previously been deployed, all apps and accessories at the
   deployed site will be undeployed.

#. If the site specifies to use a Letsencrypt certificate, and no valid certificate
   is available on the device, ``certbot`` will automatically contact the Letsencrypt
   web service and attempt to obtain a valid certificate for the site. This
   involves the temporary publication of a document in the site's ``.well-known``
   subdirectory.

   If a valid certificate was found or obtained, the site will then be set up
   with it. If no valid certificate could be obtained (e.g. because Letsencrypt
   could not contact the device due to DNS problems or a lack of public IP
   address, per Letsencrypt requirements), the site will still be set up,
   but without SSL/TLS.

#. All the apps and the accessories in the new Site JSON will be deployed.
   For each of them, the :doc:`manifest JSONs <../ubos-manifest>`
   is processed for each of the roles, and each of the AppConfigurationItems
   is deployed: files are copied, directories created, databases provisioned
   and populated, and scripts run.

#. If an app at the site was previously deployed, the previously backed-up
   data will be restored, and the "upgrade" scripts will be run that were
   specified by the app and any accessories.

#. If an app at the site was not previously deployed, the "installer" scripts
   will be run that were specified by the app and any accessories.

#. The frontpage of the site will be re-enabled.

UBOS uses the ``siteid`` and the ``appconfigid`` fields in the
:doc:`../site-json` to determine whether a site and/or an AppConfiguration is being newly
deployed, redeployed or undeployed. This makes it easy to move a site from one hostname to
another (the Site JSON is the same with the same ``siteid`` and ``appconfigid``, but a
changed ``hostname``), or to move an app from one context path to another (the
``appconfigid`` is the same, just the ``context`` is different).
