Apps and accessories
====================

Apps
----

For UBOS purposes, an app is a software application that provides direct value to the
user without any further additions, integrations or customizations. Apps generally have
software dependencies only on infrastructure and platform software such as databases,
web servers, middleware, operating system etc.

UBOS is mostly focused on web apps, i.e. apps whose primary user interface is presented
using a web browser. Some examples for what UBOS would call apps are:

* ​Wordpress (blogging and publishing)
* ​Mediawiki (collaborative knowledge management)
* OwnCloud (file sharing).

Accessories
-----------

UBOS also supports what we call accessories. An accessory is a software module that adds
to or modifies the functionality of an app. Outside of UBOS, accessories have a variety of
names including plugins, themes, skins, extensions, add-ons and the like. We use the term
"accessory" as a consistent, common term for all of those.

Examples for what UBOS would call accessories are:

* Themes or skins that change the graphic layout of Wordpress
* A module that requires users to fill out a captcha before they can register for a wiki
* A module that adds a Facebook Like button to an app.

The UBOS repositories contains both apps and accessories. The process for creating
an installable UBOS package is largely the same for apps and accessories.
