Running UBOS from a boot stick
==============================

You can install UBOS on a USB flash drive, and boot a standard PC directly from it.
This will leave your PC's hard drive unchanged and lets you try out UBOS easily:

#. Download a UBOS boot image from `depot.ubos.net`.
   Alpha images are at
   `http://depot.ubos.net/red/x86_64/images <http://depot.ubos.net/red/x86_64/images>`_.
   Look for a file named ``ubos_red_x86_64_LATEST-1part.img``
   or ``ubos_red_x86_64_LATEST-1part.img.xz`` (the same, compressed; this will download
   more quickly and more cheaply). This file should **not** contain the letters
   ``-vbox``.

#. Write this image file "raw" to a USB flash drive. This operation depends on your
   operating system, and there are many excellent guides on-line for all sorts of
   operating systems.

   If you are on Linux, this should work:

   * Determine the device name of your USB flash drive. For example, run ``lsblk`` before
     you insert the USB flash drive, and then after. The device that has shown up is
     the device that you just inserted, minus the partition number (if any). For
     example, the device name may be ``/dev/sdx``.

     .. warning:: Make sure you get the device name right, otherwise you might accidentally
        destroy the data on some other hard drive!

        Also make sure your boot stick does not contain any valuable data; it will be
        mercilessly overwritten.

   * Determine the file name of the image you downloaded. Let's assume it is
     ``~/Downloads/ubos_red_x86_64_LATEST-1part.img``. If you downloaded a compressed
     version, uncompress the file first.

   * Write the image using ``dd``, such as::

         > dd if=~/Downloads/ubos_red_x86_64_LATEST-1part.img of=/dev/sdx bs=1M

     replacing ``/dev/sdx`` with the device name of your USB flash drive.

     This may take 10min or longer, depending on the speed of your USB drive, so be
     patient.

   * When done, for good measure::

        > sync

     and wait for a little bit. Rumor has it some flash drives keep writing for some
     time after the OS thinks they are done. If that is true for your device, and you
     remove the device prematurely, you may end up with a corrupted image without a good
     way of telling it happened.

#. Remove the USB flash drive, insert it into a spare x86 computer that is currently off,
   and boot that computer from the USB flash drive. Depending on that computer's BIOS,
   you may have to set it to allow booting from USB first, or change the boot order, so the
   computer actually boots from the USB flash drive and not some other drive. Some BIOSs
   are less than friendly about this, and you may need to experiment some.

#. When the boot process is finished, log in as user ``root``. By default, there is no
   password on the console.

#. If you have Ethernet plugged in, and your network runs DHCP (most networks do), your
   computer should automatically acquire an IP address. You can check with::

      > ip addr

   Make sure you are connected to the internet before attempting to proceed.

#. Update the code to the latest and greatest::

      > ubos-admin update

#. You are now ready to :doc:`set up your first app and site </users/firstsite>`.
