The UBOS Staff
==============

Overview
--------

Any standard USB flash drive can be used to securely initialize devices running UBOS
during boot. We call such a device the "UBOS Staff".

Today, this allows the user (the :term:`Shepherd`) to automatically provision an ``ssh``
account for key-based administrator login on the device. In the future, additional
configuration information may be supported.

with a longer discussion.

UBOS Staff device configuration
-------------------------------

Device format and name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any standard USB flash drive can be used as the UBOS staff. It is recommended that such a
USB flash drive only be used as UBOS staff, and not for other purposes at the same time.

The drive must have a "VFAT" ("Windows") partition called ``UBOS-STAFF``; otherwise
UBOS will ignore the drive during boot. This can often be accomplished simply by inserting
a new USB flash drive in a computer, and renaming the device to ``UBOS-STAFF``.

Adding an existing ssh key to the device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to use an existing ssh public key with your UBOS device(s), UBOS expects
configuration information in the following file system layout::

   shepherd/
       ssh/
           id_rsa.pub

I.e., a file called ``id_rsa.pub`` must be contained in a directory named ``ssh``, which
in turn must be contained in a directory called ``shepherd`` at the root level of the
directory hierarchy.

This file ``id_rsa.pub`` must contain a valid ``ssh`` public key. You can use any existing
``ssh`` public key for which you have the corresponding private key.

Have UBOS auto-generate a new key pair:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To have UBOS auto-generate a new key pair, insert a blank UBOS Staff during boot. UBOS
will automatically generate the key pair, save it to the UBOS Staff, and create a
shepherd account on the device.

Note: it is recommended you move the private key from the UBOS Staff to a secure
place on your computer and delete it from the UBOS Staff.

To log into a remote UBOS device as the shepherd
------------------------------------------------

On the computer that has the private ``id_rsa`` file, execute the following command::

   > ssh -i id_rsa shepherd@ip

where ``id_rsa`` is the private file from above, and ``ip`` is the IP address or
hostname of your device, such as ``ubos-pc.local`` (see :doc:`networking`)

You must have copied the ``id_rsa`` file to your computer. You cannot use ``id_rsa``
directly from the UBOS Staff, as the DOS filesystem on the UBOS Staff cannot
limit access to the file, and ssh will refuse to use the file if it is world-readable.

UBOS boot behavior with Staff present
-------------------------------------

When UBOS boots, UBOS checks for the presence of a disk with a partition named
``UBOS-STAFF``. If it detects such a disk, it looks for the ``id_rsa.pub`` file in the
location described above.

If UBOS finds such a file, UBOS:

1. Creates a Linux user called ``shepherd`` unless it exists already.

2. Saves the content of ``id_rsa.pub`` verbatim as ``~shepherd/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``. This
   means that the user can log into the device over the network, as user ``shepherd``,
   as long as the user uses the corresponding private key for authentication.

3. UBOS gives the ``shepherd`` account certain administration rights, such as the
   ability to invoke ``sudo ubos-admin``, ``systemctl``, ``reboot`` and the like.
