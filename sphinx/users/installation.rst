Installation
============

You can currently either :doc:`run UBOS from a boot stick </users/installation/virtualbox>` or
:doc:`run UBOS in a VirtualBox virtual machine </users/installation/x86_bootstick>` on an
Intel x86 computer.

**For now, try out UBOS on the** ``red`` **channel.** ``yellow`` and ``green``
aren't available yet. (See also :doc:`/developers/buildrelease`.)
